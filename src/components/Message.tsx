    <h1>PALINDROME CHECKER</h1>
    <p>
        A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). </p>
    <p>In other words, it remains unchanged when its order is reversed. Examples of palindromic words include "level," "radar," and "civic."</p>
    <p>Now, if you type a word, I can help you determine whether it is a palindrome or not. </p>
    <p>Simply provide the word, and I'll let you know if it reads the same both forward and backward. </p>
    <p>Go ahead and give it a try!</p>
    </div>
